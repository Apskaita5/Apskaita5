In order to add new user Role you need to change these methods:

- Administration.UserRoleListParent.GrantTablePrivileges;
- Administration.UserRole.RoleHumanReadable;
- Security.AccIdentity.GetAllRolesList.

Also you need to change WinForms methods:

- BOMapper.LogInToGUI;
- BOMapper.LogOffToGUI.

New role name should follow these rules:

- Structure of role name is RoleName & Level, e.g. "RoleName3";
- The beginning of a RoleName should not be the same as of existing roles, e.g. "TillEur" is not a legal name.
